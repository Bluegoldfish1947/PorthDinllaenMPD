# Porth Dinllaen MPD
## DCC-EX files for an entry to the MMRS Centenary Challenge. 
Porth Dinllaen MPD is a OO guage layout that is designed and built by Rob Ogden with contributions from Chris Morgan.

This repository contains the files for a DCC-EX installation that powers the layout. It consists of six turnouts, a signal, a turntable and an animated water tower.
